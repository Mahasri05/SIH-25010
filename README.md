## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution

AgriSmart Advisor is an AI and IoT-based system for small farmers that provides real-time crop, soil, pest, weather, and market guidance. Accessible via mobile, WhatsApp, and voice commands, it supports regional languages and helps farmers make informed, sustainable decisions.

Key Benefits:

Optimizes crop selection and yield

Reduces input costs and chemical use

Provides pest/disease alerts

Tracks market prices for better profits

## Technical Approach
The system integrates machine learning models for crop selection and pest/disease prediction with IoT-based soil and moisture sensors. Real-time weather data and satellite imagery are combined with historical crop and market trends. A cloud database stores all information for continuous learning and AI model improvement. Farmers receive personalized advisories through a mobile app, WhatsApp, or voice interface, ensuring accessibility for low-literacy users.


## Feasibility and Viability
The system is feasible due to the growing availability of smartphones, internet connectivity, and low-cost IoT sensors in rural areas. It is viable as it directly addresses farmers’ needs, reduces input costs, increases crop yields, and supports sustainable farming practices. With multilingual and voice-enabled access, the solution ensures adoption even among low-literacy users, while cloud-based analytics allow continuous improvement and scalability.
## Impact and Benefits
The system empowers small and marginal farmers by improving crop yields and income, reducing input costs, and promoting sustainable farming practices. Real-time advisories and AI-driven recommendations enhance decision-making, while voice and multilingual access ensure usability for low-literacy users. It strengthens rural livelihoods, contributes to food security, reduces environmental impact through efficient resource use, and fosters community knowledge sharing among farmers for long-term agricultural resilience.


## Research and References
The solution is based on research from NABARD reports, ICT-based agriculture studies, and AI-driven crop advisory systems. Key references include studies on IoT in agriculture, predictive analytics for crop yield, soil health monitoring, and sustainable farming practices, combined with insights from field surveys of small and marginal farmers to ensure real-world applicability.
